    <h4>Greetings:</h4>	  

    <p>
    My name is Kevin Meixner. I am a full-Stack Web software developer from Toronto, Canada experienced in Web software development with OpenLaszlo, PHP, SQL, JavaScript, JQuery, 
	JQuery Mobile, HTML5, CSS3, Flash ActionScript (AS3), AJAX, etc.
    </p>	

	<p>
    I have worked at <a href="http://www.sarolta.tv/web/management.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Sarolta Technologies Inc.</a> since 2006 where 
	I have developed and maintained a large online video editing application with an OpenLaszlo SWF(Flash) client front-end, PHP back-end and MySQL 
	database on a Linux Web server. I have done much testing with video and audio on the HTML5 run-time for R&D into the possibility of porting the 
	video editing application to run completely in HTML5 in the future. I have also developed JQuery Mobile client front-ends to interface with the 
	same PHP back-end.
    </p>	

	<p>
    I also have experience with many common web site and programming technologies (JavaScript, JQuery, XHTML/CSS, ASP, JSP, Java, C++, etc.) from my 
	work experience over the past 12+ years.
    </p>
